All of the codes in this folder are for portfolioi credit risk model (PCRM). Programming language is python.

The a1000d10.txt in the data folder is the loading factors data ("a_k" in PCRM) needed for running the PCRM experiments. Simply keeping this data in the same folder as all the code in this folder, then people can directly run each of the code in python complier. Since there are random numbers generated in the code, each run of the code may get a slightly different result.
